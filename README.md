IMPORTANT NOTES FOR LECTURER/GRADER (This is to make sure that you can test out all features correctly):
+ Our document root is the Web-Programming-ASM3 folder, so when you test our website for grading purposes, make sure to change directory on your terminal to the Web-Programming-ASM3 folder before starting a localhost server; Then, you just need to type in your localhost address to access the Mall Home Page (for example: localhost:8000)

+ Before gaining access to the admin pages, you must first create an admin account (the install.php file). Just type in your localhost address followed by /install.php (for example: localhost:8000/install.php). After setting up your admin account, you must delete the install.php file from the folder to continue with the other features.

+ For admin users: To access the admin features, you just need to add a (/admin) appendix after the localhost address (for example: localhost:8000/admin). If you are logged in already, this should take you straight to the dashboard. Otherwise, it will redirect you to the admin-login.php page, where you have to log in using the username and password created with the install.php file.
